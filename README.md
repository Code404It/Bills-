This application is called BILLS. 

BILLS was created to keep a person on track for paying their bills on time. A user creates an account. The user then adds bills individually to their account. The input for the bill is the due date, total, and company name. The user also has the ability to idicate if the bill has been paid or not. Once the user has entered all of the information, the user can edit or delete the bill for reasons only the user knows.
